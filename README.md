# Progressive Tax System Calculator

This project's goal is to help one calculate his taxes in the complex Progressive Taxation System.

Usage:

For the CLI tool, run main.py. 
Enter your annual income. Then, either select your country or enter a CSV file that stores your local tax levels.

The program will show you how much you need to pay.
